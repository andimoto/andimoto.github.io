### **3D printed case for Raspberry Pi & Allo Piano 2.2 DAC**
![CAD Case](/img/rpi-piano-case/case-img-complete.jpg)

<br>

The last days I was playing around with an Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Piano 2.2 DAC on top of it.
I use Moodeaudio as audio player with which I'm very happy! 

Unfortunatelly, I couldn't find a case which fits this combination. I also need a closed intransparent case.
So I decided to build one. As I don't have a 3D printer, I use a 3D printing service with which
I was very happy with the last 3D prints.

The case is much bigger than the RPi, which keeps the design very simple. I want to just set the 
Pi into the case and mount it with hex brass standoffs at the bottom and at the cap.
This also keeps the cap in place.

For CAD I used FreeCAD (0.17) and exported the models as ***.stl** files.

... Waiting for 3D printed case ... 

More later...
